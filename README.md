# This project is an image gallery built using HTML and CSS. The gallery displays a grid of 12 images with a sleek and minimalist design. Each image is styled with a grayscale filter, rounded corners, and a subtle hover effect that reveals color, applies a drop shadow, and displays a hidden caption. The layout is organized in a 3x4 grid, and the hover transitions create an engaging, interactive user experience. The design is adaptable, with margins and spacing optimized for various screen sizes
